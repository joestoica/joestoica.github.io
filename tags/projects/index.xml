      <description>This post is a summary of the final project that I completed for my Statistical Computing course in my first semester of grad school. The goal of this project was to recreate two figures from a paper authored by Tony and Stumpf, “Simulation-based model selection for dynamical systems in systems and population biology”. This paper uses the approximate bayesian computation (or ABC) algorithm to model a few fairly complex statistical models.</description>

      <description>During my daily dose of reddit browsing, I came across this post and was subsequently pretty confused. How can an office be THAT high? Amidst my bewilderment, I noticed that it came from the subreddit
SubredditSimulator, and its hilarity immediately grabbed my attention. If you are unfamiliar with how Reddit operates, it is basically a giant forum split into thousands of subcommunities called &amp;ldquo;subreddits.&amp;rdquo; Users are allowed to subscribe to whatever subreddits they want to so they can regularly view its content, create posts in any subreddit, and comment on any post they like.</description>

      <description>A Leaflet map of the 2016 U.S. Election The United States 2016 presidential election seemed like it would be an easy victory for the DNC&amp;rsquo;s Hillary Clinton over the GOP&amp;rsquo;s Donald Trump.
However, Trump came out the victor, depsite losing the popular vote by three million votes. This election has inspired me to dig deeper into the voting data. Through this investigation, I also wanted to become more familiar with choropleth maps in R, and make them interactive using the leaflet package.</description>
