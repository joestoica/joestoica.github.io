      <description>This post is a summary of the final project that I completed for my Statistical Computing course in my first semester of grad school. The goal of this project was to recreate two figures from a paper authored by Tony and Stumpf, “Simulation-based model selection for dynamical systems in systems and population biology”. This paper uses the approximate bayesian computation (or ABC) algorithm to model a few fairly complex statistical models.</description>
