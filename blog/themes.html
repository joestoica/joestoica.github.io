		<h1><small>You underestimate the power of the</small> <br> Dark Side</h1>
		<p>
			My eyesight is terrible, and staring at a computer screen all day definitely doesn't help my sensitive eyes. Because of this, I am a huge believer in dark themes for just about everything I do on the computer. Whether it is the environment I'm currently working in (in this case I'm using the Atom text editor with, you guessed it, the One Dark theme enabled), or watching YouTube videos, you can bet I will be using a dark theme if it's available. So here are some of the themes I implement in my everyday life to keep my eyes happy <br><br>
			Note: these are my opinions and what works for me, so definitely play around to find what works for you!
		</p>

		<h2><u id="firefox">Firefox CSS</u></h2>

		<div style="text-align: center">
			<img src="../images/userChrome.jpg" width="100%" />
		</div>

		<p>
			One of my favorite features of using Firefox is that users can completely redesign the UI using CSS. There is even a dedicated <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/">subreddit</a>  for users to post their own code and get feedback. My CSS is primarily take from
			<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/7dr9on/updated_flatdark_uwp_style/">/u/Guerra24's post</a>. I changed some colors to better suit my personal taste and added some extra features that were not included in his file. My code can be found <a href="https://github.com/joestoica/joestoica.github.io/blob/master/css/userChrome.css">here.</a> If you don't know how to set up your own CSS on Firefox, follow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/73dvty/tutorial_how_to_create_and_livedebug_userchromecss/">this guide</a>.

		<h2><u id="rstudio">RStudio Theme</u></h2>

		<div style="text-align: center">
			<img src="../images/rstudio.jpg" width="100%" />
		</div>

		<p>
			I love RStudio. It's objectively the best IDE for R, and I don't think anything else even comes close to it. I work in it everyday for at least a couple of hours, so naturally I want to be able to look at my screen for a while without destroying my eyes and getting headaches. The photo above is my theme for RStudio. Here is my setup:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>RStudio Theme:</strong> Modern</li>
				<li><strong>Editor Font:</strong> Courier</li>
				<li><strong>Editor Font Size:</strong> 12</li>
				<li><strong>Editor Theme:</strong> Tomorrow Night Bright (although sometimes I'll use Tomorrow Night cause it's a little lighter!)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2><u id="jup">Juptyer Notebook</u></h2>
		<div style="text-align: center">
			<img src="../images/jupyter.jpg" width="100%" />
		</div>

		<p>
			I don't typically use Jupyter Notebooks for Python, but they definitely have a place in my programming environment arsenal. There is <a href="https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes">this super great repo</a> that allows you to change your JN theme. Installation instructions are found in the README!
			After a successful installation, copy and paste this in your terminal:<br>
			<code>jt -t oceans16 -f roboto -fs 12</code><br>


		</p>

		<h2><u id="web">Random Websites</u></h2>
		<p>
			There are a lot of websites that are starting to implement dark theme overlays, and this (growing) list is comprised of websites I use frequently!
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reddit with <a href="https://redditenhancementsuite.com/">Reddit Enhancement Suite</a></li>
			<li>Twitter</li>
			<li>YouTube</li>
			<li>DuckDuckGo</li>
		</ul>
