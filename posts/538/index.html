      <p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">Fivethirtyeight</a> is one of my favorite news
websites for interesting political articles and insightful sports predictions.
Fivethirtyeight is spearheaded by Editor in Chief
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver">Nate Silver</a>, the popular
statistician who wrote the excellent book,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions-Fail-but-ebook/dp/B007V65R54">The Signal and the Noise</a>.
But what I truly love about Fivethirtyeight is their unbiased and objective
approach to their methodology, and how they present their data through their
visualizations. They use a fairly clean and minimal style, following the idea of
a low data-ink ratio, which is something I try to replicate in my own
visualizations.</p>
<p>The goal of this page aims to recreate some of their visualizations as
accurately as possible using ggplot. The primary issue though, is that they don&rsquo;t
always publish all of their data used to make the visualizations, so I can only
recreate visualizations that have data simply presented, like using direct labels for
example. This page will be updated as I find more visualizations to replicate.</p>
<h2 id="article-from-feb-4th-2019">Article from Feb 4th, 2019</h2>
<p>My first recreation came from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-no-one-should-be-surprised-by-democratic-calls-for-northams-resignation/">this article</a>&rdquo; discussing the attitudes toward racism in the Republican and Democratic party.  You can see their visualization in the article. My attempt is below, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/joestoica/joestoica.github.io/blob/master/code/538_1.R">link to the code I used to make it.</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/538.png" alt="Remade Visualization"></p>
<p>Creating this plot was fairly tricky, but I actually learned quite a bit trying
to recreate this, as well as some visualization ideas that I can use in future
visualizations. For example, something subtle that they did was actually using
geom_point twice: one with the color for the colored point, and then another
point geometry directly underneath it that matches the background color of the
panel, giving it a subtle but aesthetically pleasing space from the lines. I
also wasn&rsquo;t aware of ggplot&rsquo;s ability to add custom labels in the
scale_x_continuous() functions, so I was then able to match their labels
exactly. Another subtlety that I hadn&rsquo;t thought about was making the axis text
grey instead of black, which allows the eye to not be as distracted by placing
less emphasis on the axis, and more on the actual visualization.</p>
