      <description>This post is a summary of the final project that I completed for my Statistical Computing course in my first semester of grad school. The goal of this project was to recreate two figures from a paper authored by Tony and Stumpf, “Simulation-based model selection for dynamical systems in systems and population biology”(which can be found here. This paper uses the approximate bayesian computation (or ABC) algorithm to model a few fairly complex statistical models.</description>

      <title>Remaking Visualizations from 538</title>

      <description>Fivethirtyeight is one of my favorite news websites for interesting political articles and insightful sports predictions. Fivethirtyeight is spearheaded by Editor in Chief Nate Silver, the popular statistician who wrote the excellent book, The Signal and the Noise. But what I truly love about Fivethirtyeight is their unbiased and objective approach to their methodology, and how they present their data through their visualizations. They use a fairly clean and minimal style, following the idea of a low data-ink ratio, which is something I try to replicate in my own visualizations.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Joe Stoica. I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student from Indiana University pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in statistical science. This coming summer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be interning at Cook Medical, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be a statistics intern in their Quality Engineering department. This previous summer I was the media analytics intern at MullenLowe Mediahub, where I assisted in data analysis and reporting for advertising campaigns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously worked at Upland Brewing Co., where I compiled and analyzed supply chain data, and with the Cognitive Development Lab at IU, where I completed a semester long analysis project regarding the pathways for how children learn the mathematical concept of place value.</description>
