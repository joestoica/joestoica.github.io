      <description>Hi! My name is Joe Stoica. I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student from Indiana University pursuing a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in statistical science. This coming summer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be interning at Cook Medical, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be a statistics intern in their Quality Engineering department. This previous summer I was the media analytics intern at MullenLowe Mediahub, where I assisted in data analysis and reporting for advertising campaigns.
I&amp;rsquo;ve previously worked at Upland Brewing Co., where I compiled and analyzed supply chain data, and with the Cognitive Development Lab at IU, where I completed a semester long analysis project regarding the pathways for how children learn the mathematical concept of place value.</description>
