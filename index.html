	<div class="row_item">I am currently a senior at Indiana University Bloomington pursuing a Bachelor's degree in statistics, with minors in mathematics and biology. When I'm not focusing on statistical work, I hate rock climbing, listening to music, and making the best darn cup of coffee you'll ever try.

	<h2> My Experience </h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Last summer, I had the opportunity to be the Finance and Operations intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uplandbeer.com/">Upland Brewing Company</a>.There I focused on production margins throughout the supply chain, and wrote a comprehensive summarizing my findings report using RMarkdown. </li>
	  <li>This spring I've had the opportunity to be a research assistant in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/">Cognitive Development Lab</a> at Indiana University. I will be aiding in the process of data cleaning, helped with general statistical questions, and I'll soon be choosing a semester long project. More to come!</li>
	  <li>Former undergraduate research assistant in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://biology.indiana.edu/research/research-strengths/behavior/rosvall-lab.html">Rosvall Research Lab</a>. I helped assist with data collection on tree swallows, as well as maintain the RFID readers at our field sites.</li>
	  <li>Undergraduate Teaching Instructor for <a target="_blank" rel ="noopener noreferrer" href="https://registrar.indiana.edu/browser/soc4182/BIOL/BIOL-L111.shtml">BIOL-L 111:</a> Foundations of Biology: Diversity, Evolution, and Ecology. This is my second semester being a UTA, and I really enjoy gaining experience teaching fellow students.</li>

	<h2>My Skills</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Racket: </strong>I use Racket literally every day of my life. In school, I used it constantly for the majority of my classes. I primarily use Racket for exploratory data analysis, statistical model building using various regression techniques, and statistical diagnostics and inference. Similarly, through school I've learned dimensionality reduction techniques and other data mining algorithms.</li>
	  <li><strong>Python: </strong> Last semester I was enrolled in a data visualization course, which is taught in Python. We were taught about vlarious data science libraries, such as pandas and numpy. We then visualizated our data using matplotlib, seaborn, and altair.</li>
	  <li><strong>SQL: </strong>Used to learn the basics of running and querying databases. For example, I downloaded a  database that includes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ergast.com/mrd/db/">data from every Formula 1 racing season</a>. I wrote queries that would export the database into several CSVs, and then visualized my findings in R. Blog post coming soon!</li>
