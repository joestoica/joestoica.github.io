Hi! My name is Joe Stoica. I'm a graduate student from Indiana University 
pursuing a master's degree in statistical science. This coming summer, I'll be
interning at [Cook Medical](https://www.cookmedical.com/), where I'll be a 
statistics intern in their Quality Engineering department. This previous summer
I was the media analytics intern at [MullenLowe Mediahub](http://www.mullenlowemediahub.com/), 
where I assisted in data analysis and reporting for advertising campaigns. 


I've previously worked at [Upland  Brewing Co.](https://www.uplandbeer.com/), 
where I compiled and analyzed supply chain data, and  with the 
[Cognitive Development Lab](https://cogdev.sitehost.iu.edu/) at IU, where I 
completed a semester long analysis project regarding the  pathways for how
children learn the mathematical concept of place value. Have a closer look at
some of the things I've worked on or feel free to contact me if you would like
to see my resume.
