    <!-- About -->
    <div>
      <div>Hello! This past spring I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a Bachelor's degree in statistics, and minors in mathematics and biology. This fall, I will be furthering my statistics education at Indiana University where I will begin the Master of Science in Statistical Science program. My primary interests involve statistical computing and data visualization, but my main passion is uncovering the stories hidden in the data that I analyze.

    <!-- Experience -->
    <div>
      <h1> My Experience </h1>
      <ul>
	<li> This summer, I am the Media Analytics Intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.mullenlowemediahub.com/">MullenLowe Mediahub</a>. </li>
	
	<li>This past spring I was a research assistant in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/">Cognitive Development Lab</a> at Indiana University. I worked on a semester long research project that explored how children gain implicit and explicit knowledge about place values and how it relates to future mathematical achievement.</li>

	<li> Last summer, I was the Finance and Operations intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.uplandbeer.com/">Upland Brewing Company</a>.There I focused on production margins throughout the supply chain, and wrote a comprehensive report summarizing my findings report using RMarkdown. </li>

	<li>This is my second semester as anm undergraduate teaching instructor for <a target="_blank" rel ="noopener noreferrer" href="https://registrar.indiana.edu/browser/soc4182/BIOL/BIOL-L111.shtml">BIOL-L 111:</a> Foundations of Biology: Diversity, Evolution, and Ecology. I really enjoyed the experience of teaching fellow students essential biology concepts.</li>
	
	<li>I am a former undergraduate research assistant in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://biology.indiana.edu/research/research-strengths/behavior/rosvall-lab.html">Rosvall Research Lab</a>. I helped assist with data collection on tree swallows nesting behavior, as well as maintain the RFID readers at the field sites.</li>

    <!-- Skills -->
    <div>
      <h1>My Skills</h1>
      <ul>
	<li><strong>R: </strong>In school, I used R for the majority of my classwork, whether it was building linear mixed models for my consulting homework or exploratory data analysis with an emphasis on visualization. I primarily use R for EDA, statistical model building using various regression techniques, and statistical diagnostics and inference. Similarly, through my computer science courses I've learned dimensionality reduction techniques and other data mining and classification algorithms.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Python: </strong> In undergrad I was enrolled in a data visualization course, which was taught in Python. We were taught about various data science libraries, such as pandas and numpy. We then visualizated our data using matplotlib, seaborn, and altair.</li>
	
	<li><strong>SQL: </strong> I learned the basics of running and querying databases. For example, I downloaded a  database that includes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ergast.com/mrd/db/">data from every Formula 1 racing season</a>. I wrote queries that would export the database into several CSVs, and then visualized my findings in R. Blog post coming soon!</li>
