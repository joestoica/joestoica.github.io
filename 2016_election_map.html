            <h2>2016 Election Map</h2>
          </header>
          <p class="tab">The United States 2016 presidential election seemed like it would
            be an <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/">
            easy victory for the DNC's Hillary Clinton over the GOP's Donald Trump.</a>            However, Trump came out the victor, depsite having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016">
              three million less votes than his opponent. </a>This election
            has inspired me to dig deeper into the voting data and explore various
            relationships through almost every county across the nation. Through
            this investigation, I also wanted to become more familiar with choropleth
            maps in R, and turn them into interactive maps using the leaflet
            package.. If you would like to see the code used to make this, click
            <a href="https://github.com/joestoica/2016-Presidential-Election-Analysis/blob/master/election_analysis.Rmd"> here.

            <h2>Examination Through Mapping </h2>
          </header>

          <p class="tab">
            There are a few different ways to explore the map. Clicking on an individual
            county reveals relevant election data about that specific county,
            such as the county name, the winnnig candidate, the number of votes
            each candidate received, and the voting margin between them. The
            radio buttons in the bottom left allow the map to be shaded in four
            different way. The first map examines the candidate who won each
            county, where Clinton is mapped to blue counties and Trump to red.
            The next map shows the percent margin of each county using a diverging
            color palette, where the darker the shade of the county, the larger
            the percent margin is for that candidate. The third and fourth maps
            are similar to the second, except these show vote margins by candidate.
          </p>

            <h2>Creation of the Map</h2>
          </header>

          <p class="tab">
            Making this map was actually quite a challenge for me. As it turns out, I ended
            up using three different datasets combined into one larger dataset.
            One dataset had general party election information by county, another
            had candidate data by county, and the final was a shapefile to use
            during the actual creation of the map. The major downfall of this
            data is that some counties were excluded, so if the candidate data
            set was missing one county, it had to be removed from the other
            too. This is why Washington D.C. and the entire state of Alaska
            were removed from the final map.
          </p>

          <p class="tab">
            Once the data was compiled it was smooth sailing. All I had to complete was
            the palettes, popup, and the map itself. It's worth mentioning that
            the diverging color palette used in the second map had to be crafted
            carefully, due to the fact that the color scales darker with larger
            winning margins. In order to represent the margins accurately, the
            palettes must scale equally both ways since the two candidates'
            maximum are different sizes.
