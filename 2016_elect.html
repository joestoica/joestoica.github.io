            <h2>2016 Presidential Election Analysis</h2>
          </header>
          <p class="tab">The United States 2016 presidential election seemed like it would be an <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/">
            easy victory for the DNC's Hillary Clinton over the GOP's Donald Trump.</a> However, Trump came out the victor, depsite having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016">
               3,000,000 less votes than his opponent. </a>This election has inspired me to dig deeper into the voting data and explore various relationships through almost every county across the nation. Through this investigation, I also wanted to become
            even more familiar with R, and learn how to create interactive and user-friendly maps. If you would like to see the code used to make this, click <a href="https://github.com/joestoica/2016-Presidential-Election-Analysis"> here. </a> So without
            further ado, here is my most recent iteration of the map!</p>

      <section id="two">
        <div class="container">
          <header class="major">
            <h2>Examination Through Mapping </h2>
          </header>
          <iframe seamless src="./map.html" width="100%" height="500"></iframe>

          <p class="tab">There are a few different ways to explore the map. Clicking on an individual county reveals relevant election data to that specific county. The radio buttons in the bottom left allow the user to select one of four maps to view. The first map
            examines the candidate who won each county, where Clinton is mapped to blue counties and Trump to red. The next map shows the percent margin of each county. The darker the shade of the county, the bigger the percent margin is for that candidate.
            The third and fourth maps are similar to the second, except these show vote margins by candidate. </p>

        <div class="container">
          <header class="major">
            <h2>Future Additions</h2>
          </header>
          <p class="tab">Eventually, I would like to add various population metrics to the county popup. For example, when a county is clicked, it would also display some information comparing the county to the state, such as statistics on income level, population,
            education level, etc. But as of right now, I am very busy with school, so I'm not sure when this will happen!</p>
