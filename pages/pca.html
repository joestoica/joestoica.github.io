	  Recently it sure feels like the growing partisan divide in the United States is larger than it's ever been. Almost like die-hard sports fans, people cling to their party affiliation as a major part of their identity. While the general public definitely seems more separated, does this concept also apply to our elected officials? In an assignment as a part of my exploratory data analysis undergrad class, we investigated this question using principle component analysis and a dataset involving how U.S. Senators voted from 1989 to 2014 (If I can get my hands on more data I will definitely expand this range). I'll start off by explaining the PCA bit!

	<h1>So how does it work?</h1>
	<p>
	  I won't get into explaining the fine details of PCA, but there are a ton of resources out there which could explain it better than I can anyway. The data I worked with was congressional voting data that was broken down year over year (from 1989 to 2014). Every row in the data is an ID for a congress member, while the columns indicate every bill that was voted on for that year and how each congress member voted. I recoded the data to be 1 if the vote was 'Yea', -1 to be 'Nay', and 0 if it were some other value. This way PCA could be run in an interpretable manner. Once every dataframe was recoded, PCA was ran on each year. The data was further cleaned to include information about each congress member. 
	</p>

	<p>
	  I then did two separate exploratory analyses. The first was to just show the PCA biplot for each year to see if there actually is growing divide. That can be seen in the first Tableau dashboard below. The second analysis takes a selected congress member that, and compares their first principal component to the average principal component of both parties. This calculated difference can be thought of as a dissimilarity score, where a lower score indicates similar voting behavior to that party, and dissimilarity grows as the score increases.

<h1>Vote Data PCA</h1>

	<p>
	  If you would like to see and interact with the Tableau Dashboard, <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/joe.stoica#!/vizhome/Voting_15693263763670/VotingDissimilarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow this link here</a>. The first dashboard is the PCA visualization for every year of voting data. Since we're trying to see if this voting data shows any indication of division in our political system, we would expect to see the two colored groups drift further apart over time. No concrete conclusions can be necessarily drawn since this is primarily an exploratory analysis, but it does sort of appear that the two parties grew a little further apart, though there are definitely some exceptions. 
	</p>
	


	<h1>Dissimilarity Scores EDA</h1>

	<p>
	  If you navigate to the other dashboard, it shows how every congress member in the dataset voted compared to the two parties. Once again, the closer the value is to 0, the more similar they voted to that party for that year, so a larger bar indicates a larger voting discrepancy.
