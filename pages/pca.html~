	  Recently it sure feels like the growing partisan divide in the United States is larger than it's ever been. Almost like die-hard sports fans, people cling to their party affiliation as a major part of their identity. While the general public definitely seems more separated, does this concept also apply to our elected officials? In an assignment as a part of my exploratory data analysis undergrad class, we investigated this question using principle component analysis and a dataset involving how U.S. Senators voted from 1989 to 2014 (If I can get my hands on more data I will definitely expand this range). I'll start off by explaining the PCA bit, and then go into my old R code from class and how I remade it to be more R.

	<h1>So how does it work?</h1>
	<p>
	  I won't get into explaining PCA, but there are a ton of resources out there who could explain it better than I can anyway. The data I worked with congressional voting data that was broken down year over year (from 1989 to 2014). Every row in the data is an ID for a congress member, while the columns indicate the every bill that was voted on for that year and how each congress member voted. I recoded the data to be 1 if the vote was 'Yea', -1 to be 'Nay', and 0 if it were another vote. Once every dataframe was recoded, PCA was ran on each year.
