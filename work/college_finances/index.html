      <p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of writing a post like this for a few months now. There are endless blogs and vlogs offering tips and tricks to students on how to successfully navigate the minefield of being an independent college student for their first time. However, I feel like sharing the various technology and productivity strategies thathave added structure to many aspects of my life, which in turn has allowed me to stress less about life and put more focus on being an organized and motivated student. Here are some things that I plan on writing about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Finance<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Staying Organized<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Being Productive<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-your-finances">Managing your finances</h2>
<p>Personally, nothing stresses me out more than finances. Everyone knows that attending college is not cheap, and it&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed with trying to keep track of living expenses, payments for school, and money for your own personal use. There are plenty of students I know who live paycheck to paycheck, and they have rough ideas in their head of what they can spend before their accounts are completely drained (I&rsquo;m absolutely guilty of this, because I spent the majority of my undergrad mentally calculating if I could afford one more Chipotle burrito bowl).</p>
<p>One day I realized that being blissfully ignorant of the contents of my checking account is most likely not the smartest approach, and I became even more aware of this after applying for my first credit card (which if you don&rsquo;t alrady have one, you should look into getting one!). This then forced me into the habit of checking my financial apps more frequently since I was deathly afraid of not being able to afford my credit card payments and take on even more debt. Because of my education and familiarity with data software, I was led down a personal finance rabbit hole looking for some way to accurately budget and manage my spending habits, and this is when I discovered YNAB. YNAB (or You Need A Budget) is a personal budgeting platform that allows you to take better control of the contents of your wallet.</p>
<p>YNAB is built upon <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/">four rules</a>. I won&rsquo;t go into a deep dive on them, but essentially you want to focus only on the money you currently have (and not make projections on your next paycheck) and assign each and every one of your dollars to some aspect of your budget. This lets you set aside money for things that you spend money on frequently, such as rent, groceries, or gas, as well as prepare for long-term purchases that you&rsquo;ll have to make. For example, if you set aside money monthly for your textbooks, it will feel like less of a shock to your bank account when you actually have to buy them next semester since you have that money already assigned to that task.</p>
<p>Not only is budgeting useful, but YNAB helped me figure out where my money was actually going on a monthly basis, because sometimes you don&rsquo;t really realize how much you spend on Chipotle. YNAB allows you to connect your financial accounts directly into the app, however I elected to manually enter all of my purchases myself. This way, I&rsquo;m extremely aware of how I&rsquo;m spending my money. Budgeting has illuminated some of my personal negative spending habits. YNAB has helped me with reprioritizing for all of the essential costs first, and then seeing how much I can actually spend, guilt free.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a learning curve for using the YNAB software and adopting these philosophies to your spending habits. There are plenty of resources available online, but once you get over the initial hump the payoff is immense. I can honestly say that YNAB has changed my life significantly. I worry much less about my money and where it will go each month, and in turn this allows me to stress about other things, like the exam I have next Thursday (and am currently writing this post instead of studying for). YNAB offers the first year free to students, but then turns to a yearly subscription. But if you budget for it over the year, you won&rsquo;t even worry about it :)</p>
